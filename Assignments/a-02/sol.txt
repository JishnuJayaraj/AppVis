2.1 Linear interpolation
a)

    fp = f0 + alpha(f1-f0)


    similarly in p
    (2,4)t = (0,2)t + alpha((5,7)t - (0,2)t)
    Solving
    in x, alpha= 2/5
    also in y, alpha = 2/5

    substitute alpha in fp equation

    fp = 10 + 2/5 (18-10)
        = 66/5
b)
    ploting the points ABCD is a paralellogram

    1/4(A+B+C+D) = 1/4(20,16)t 
                    =(5,4)
                    = P, means P is the midpoint

    therefore f at P is also the average of all points
                    = 1/4(7,9,11,13)
                    = 10

    Bilenear interpolation: P = (1-u)(1-v)A + u(1-v)B + (1-u)v D + uv C
    (for unit square u=v=1/2 at midpoint) -> get the same eq above

    OR sub A<B<C<D in eq get linear set of eq in u and v for X and y
    and Y is given by (1+6v) {from y coord of all points, we move from 1 to 7}
        X is given by (1+6u+2v) {there is also shearing}
        ** all the product terms, ie uv is cancelled away**

c)
    shifting, its not a paralellogram anynore, hense uv erm reamins and hense hard to calcualte
    Hence should use stensil walk algorithm to solve(from lecture)
    P = ... same as above
      = phi(u,v)

      P  ~= P0 + J _phi(delu, delv)t 
      P - P0 = delx = J_phi(delu, delv)
      (delu, delv)  = J^-1 _phi (delx1, dely1)

2.2 barycentric coord
a)
    P3 = alphaP0 + betaP1 + gammaP2
    alpha + beta + gamma =1

    x3 = alpha.X0 + beta.X1 + gamma.X2
    Y3 = ...
    1  = alpha + beta + gamma

    Cramer to solve this matrix (3 eq, 3 unknowns)


    But more easily can be solved by taking Area of segments as barycentric coord

    alpha = area(A0)/area(A) ; beta = ... ; gamma = ...
