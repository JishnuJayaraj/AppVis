            Learning how to use the assignment environment and the ECMA programming language
        </p>
        <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            In case this tutorial is not enough we recommend 
            <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.w3schools.com/js">w3schools.com</a>.
            There you find tutorials for JavaScript and also HTML, CSS, and many other topics related to web development.
        </p>
        <p>
            Why JavaScript?
            <ul>
                <li>Language of the web. You might need it later.</li>
                <li>Easy to learn.</li>
                <li>Platform independent (all you need is a text editor and a browser).</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            Before learning JavaScript you should know some basics about the Hyper Text Markup Language, also known as HTML.
            Its elements are represented by tags. Metadata is written in <b>head</b>, visible text in <b>body</b>. Here is an example
            of a simple HTML file:
        </p>
        <pre><code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
    &lt;head&gt;
        &lt;title&gt;Page Title&lt;/title&gt;
    &lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;body&gt;
        &lt;h1&gt;This is a Heading&lt;/h1&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;This is a paragraph.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;</code></pre>
        <p>
            JavaScript code is written in between <b>script</b>-tags.
        </p>
        <pre><code>&lt;script&gt;
    Write some JavaScript code here...
&lt;/script&gt;</code></pre>
        <p>
            Alternatively scripts can also be written in external files and included in the html file. This is what we do here so you
            do not need to care about html or css. All you have to do is write some JavaScript functions.
        </p>
        <!-- write about modules -->

        <h2>2. Basics</h2>
        <p>
            Let's get started with JavaScript. First of all we will practice a bit in the console of your browser. Usually, it is opened by
            pressing F12 on your keyboard. If not, find help 
            <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.google.de/search?q=open+browser+console">here</a>.<br>
            You can now copy and paste all the following examples to the console and play with them.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you are familiar with C, C++, or C# then you should not have any problems in getting used to the JavaScript syntax because it
            is basically the same thing. Variables are declared and defined in the following way:
        </p>
        <pre><code>// Declaration of variables
let x, y, z;<br>/* Definition of variables */<br>x = 5;<br>y = 6;<br>z = x + y;</code></pre>
        <p>
            Statements are separated by semicolons. This is not mandatory but recommended, as a missing semicolon might cause problems.
            Comments are in C++ style and either start with // or are in between /**/. A major difference to C/C++ is that there is no type
            definition. But beware that an implicit type exists!<br>
            When declaring a new variable it has the initial value <b>undefined</b>. The <b>let</b> keyword is not mandatory but recommended
            for plenty of reasons!
        </p>
        <p>
            An alternative to <b>let</b> is <b>var</b>. If you read JavaScript tutorials you might find this a lot. But since <b>let</b> was
            introduced in JavaScript I do not see any reason to use <b>var</b>. In general <b>let</b> has the behavior you want.
        </p>
        <p>
            You can find out the type of a variable with <b>typeof</b>.
        </p>
        <pre><code>let str = "I am a string";<br>typeof(str);</code></pre>
        <p>
            Basic types are Number (64 bit floating point number), Boolean, String, and Object. Beware of implicit casting!
        </p>
        <pre><code>let y = 1;<br>typeof(y);<br>y = "1";<br>typeof(y);</code></pre>
        <p>
            You have all the common operators available and some more.
        </p>
        <pre><code>let a = 3;<br>a % 2;<br>++a;<br>a++;<br>a += 2;<br>a == "7";<br>a === "7";<br></code></pre>
        <p>
            Consider that JavaScript has two different types of comparison operators. One only checks the content the other also checks the type. 
            Usually, you want to check also the type (===).<br>
            Multiple values are stored in arrays.
        </p>
        <pre><code>let cars = ["Saab", "Volvo", "BMW"];
let name = cars[0];
cars[0] = "Opel";
console.log(cars);          // print the whole array directly
cars.sort();
cars.length;
cars.push("Audi");          // add an element to the end
cars.splice(2,1);           // remove elements
cars[7] = "Volkswagen";     // adding at higher index numbers leaves 'holes'
let cars2 = cars            // this is only a shallow copy!!
cars2[0] = "Porsche";
console.log(cars[0]);</code></pre>
        <p>
            Functions are very powerful in JavaScript for several reasons. A function can be assigned to a variable. Furthermore, not relying on 
            types means you can give a function any input, even other functions.
        </p>
        <pre><code>function myFunction(p1, p2) {
    return p1 * p2; 
}
let f = myFunction;
f(3,4);
f = (p1, p2) => { return p1 * p2; };        // yes we can do lamda expressions
f = (p1, p2) => p1 * p2;                    // and we can make them really short

function evaluate(f, x1, x2, x3) {
    return [f(x1), f(x2), f(x3)];
}
evaluate(x => x * x, 1, 2, 3);

function findMax () {                       // use arguments array to access all arguments
    let max = -Infinity ;
    for (let i in arguments) {
        if ( arguments[i] > max ) max = arguments[i];
    }
    return max;
}
findMax(1, 123, 500, 115, 44);</code></pre>
        <p>
            You have also already used objects, maybe without realizing it. An array is actually an object. The point where you might have realized was
            when we used the implicit functions of the array. Objects are very easy to create in JavaScript.
        </p>
        <pre><code>let car = {
    type: "Fiat",
    model: 500,
    color: "white",
    drive: function(){ /*do something*/ }
};

car.type;
car["type"];
car.drive();

// Object constructor function (outdated)
function Car (type, model, color){
    this.type = type;
    this.model = model;
    this.color = color;
    this.drive = function () { /*do something*/ };
}
let fiat500 = new Car ("Fiat", 500, "white");</code></pre>
        <p>
            An object that might be of interest for you is the Math object. It contains important functions and numbers.
        </p>
        <pre><code>Math.PI;<br>Math.round(4.7);<br>Math.pow(8,2);<br>Math.sqrt(64);<br>Math.max();<br>Math.random();</code></pre>
        <p>
            I assume you know about <i>if, switch, for, while</i>. Some of them were used in the previous examples. If you need more information
            you will find plenty online.
        </p>



        <h2>3. Avoiding Bugs</h2>
        <p>
            Each function creates a new local scope. All variables declared inside a function are not accessible from outside. If you use a variable
            without declaring it, it will always be in global scope. That is why you should always declare variables with the <b>let</b> keyword!<br>
        </p>
        <pre><code>myFunction();
// code here can use variable carName!

function myFunction() {
    carName = "Volvo";
    for(let i = 0; i < 5; ++i){
        // do something
    }
}</code></pre>
        <p>
            Talking about scope, there is a bit more to consider, namely hoisting. In JavaScript function declarations are hoisted, meaning all
            functions are moved to the top of the current scope.<br>
            Variable definitions are <b>not</b> hoisted! This is especially important for functions.
        </p>
        <pre><code>a(5);    // this is fine
b(5);    // this will return an error
function a(x) { console.log("a = " + x) };
let b = function(x) { console.log("b = " + x) };</code></pre>
        <p>
            Some hints for debugging: The easiest way to get some information about your code might be <b>console.log()</b> which prints out stuff
            on the console. Furthermore, you can write the <b>debugger</b> keyword in a script which will enforce the debugger of your browser.
            It has the same effect as setting a breakpoint in your debugger. Talking about debugger, your browser has one. Use it!
        </p>
        <p>
            Finally, I want to tell you some best practices which should help to avoid bugs.
            <ul>
                <li>Avoid global variables, <b>new</b>, and ==.</li>
                <li>Beware of automatic type conversions.</li>
                <li>Use a semicolon at the end of each statement.</li>
                <li>Do not access arrays with named indexes.</li>
                <li>Write in lower camelCase</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        Now you should be prepared for the upcoming assignments. You may immediately try by solving the following tasks.

        <hr style="height:3px;color:#333;background-color:#333;" />

        <h2>Assignment 0.1: Draw a polygon</h2>
        <div class="container">
            <div class="row">
                <div id="a1" class="renderwindow col-md-7 col-xs-12 float-left"></div>
                <div class="col-sm">
                    Let's keep it simple for the beginning. Your task is to create a random polygon. It has the form
                    <pre><code>[ [x1, y1, z1], [x2, y2, z2], ... ]</code></pre>
                    Write it in the function <i>randomPolygon()</i> in <i>assignment0.js</i>. Use <i>Math.random()</i> 
                    for the creation of random points. Besides that, the appearance of the polygon
                    is up to you. Just try something and see what it looks like.
                </div>
            </div>
        </div>
        
        <h2>Assignment 0.2: Draw a function</h2>
        <div class="container">
            <div class="row">
                <div id="a2" class="renderwindow col-md-7 col-xs-12 float-left"></div>
                <div class="col-sm">
                    The output of Assignment 0.1 was quite wild. Let's continue create something with a bit more
                    structure. Let us plot the function $$f(x) = x^2 - 0.5\,, \quad x \in [-2,2]. $$ You can plot a function by creating
                    an array of sample points. This sample points are then connected with straight lines. If 
                    you have enough points, it will look more or less smooth.<br>
                    Your task is to create the array of sample points. They should be stored in the same format as
                    in Assignment 0.1. Of course, the given function is only two-dimensional. Therefore, set the third component to 0.
